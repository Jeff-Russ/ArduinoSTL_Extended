# ArduinoSTL_Extended
This is a port of the uClibc++ C++ standard library implementation, packaged as
an Arduino library by [Mike Matera](https://github.com/mike-matera/ArduinoSTL),
which was subsequently extended to have inheritance-friendly STL-like containers.

It's a work in progress with new classes being added one-by-one.

Check out the original ArduinoSTL README [here](ArduinoSTL_README.md).
